##Python tools

This repository hosts a collection of general functions that I regularly use in data analysis and classification problems in particular. The main focus is a set of Python functions for visualizing the performance of classification models in the presence of skewed or imbalanced classes (a.k.a., rare events problems), which are common in comparative and international politics research.
